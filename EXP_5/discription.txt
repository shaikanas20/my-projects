DYNAMIC PRODUCT FILTER – TEST CASES & VALIDATIONS

FUNCTIONALITY:
          Real-time product filtering and selection that updates instantly as the user selects a category from the dropdown.
          Users can also click on a product to highlight it as selected.

COMPONENTS BREAKDOWN:
ELEMENT 1:
          <select id="categoryDropdown">
          Purpose: Dropdown menu for selecting product categories.
          Properties:
          id="categoryDropdown" → Provides a unique identifier for JavaScript to access the dropdown.
          Effect: Filters the product list dynamically based on the selected category.

ELEMENT 2: 
          <div id="productList">
          Purpose: Container for displaying the filtered list of products.
          Properties:
          id="productList" → Allows JavaScript to dynamically add product items.
          Effect: Dynamically renders products based on selected category.

ELEMENT 3: 
          <div class="product-item">
          Purpose: Represents an individual product in the list.
          Properties:
          class="product-item" → Provides styling and allows selection highlight.
          Effect: Clickable item that updates selection state and highlights visually.

ELEMENT 4: 
          <div class="container"> and <h2> (optional title)
          Purpose: Provides overall layout and title for the product list section.
          Effect: Organizes the dropdown and product list into a visually clear container.

JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONALITY:

Event Listeners:
          Dropdown change event → Filters products based on selected category.
          Product click event → Highlights the selected product and deselects previously selected one.

Process:
          Products are stored in a JavaScript array with name and category properties.
          renderProducts(category) dynamically filters the array and updates the DOM with matching products.
          selectProduct(div) manages selection highlighting by adding/removing the selected CSS class.
          Filtering and selection update instantly without page reload.

TEST CASES:

Valid Inputs:
          Selecting "All" → Shows all products.
          Selecting a specific category (Clothing, Gadgets, Books) → Displays only products from that category.
          Clicking a product → Highlights it as selected.
          Changing the category after selecting a product → Deselects previous selection and shows only filtered products.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
          Product list updates immediately when the category changes.
          Clicking a product highlights it and deselects any previously selected item.
          Only one product can be selected at a time.
          Filtering and selection are responsive and visually clear.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
          Understanding dynamic DOM manipulation with JavaScript (createElement, appendChild, innerHTML).
          Using arrays and .filter() to implement dynamic filtering logic.
          Handling events (click, change) to provide interactive functionality.
          Applying CSS classes dynamically to provide real-time visual feedback (selected and hover states).
          Structuring code with HTML, CSS, and JS for maintainable, modular, and interactive UI components.
